    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish, or cuttles, are marine molluscs of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda which
        also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which
        is used for control of buoyancy.
